## How to compile
```bash
$ gcc main.c -o out
$ ./out
```
### With make
After cloning the folder, go in it and compile with the command
```bash
$ make
```
If you need, here's how to install make
```bash
$ sudo apt install build.essentials
```
## At this point
I cannot make libraries. I have to test and tidy up the code, but I just don't know where to start this.
